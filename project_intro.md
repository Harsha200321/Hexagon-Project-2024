# Hexagon Project
##  Project Title - Validate PSID Drawings using Al
*   The AlM of this project is to use Al to validate the PSID drawings and respond with a proposal containing the options to correct the erroneous drawing for the given input P&ID.
*   This validation step may later be incorporated with the Hexagon P&lD software to validate the drawings.

## Objectives:  The objective of the project is to Convert the P&i Drawing images to a SFILES 2.0 Notation.
*   This essentially converts the data to a string where each component is represented as a unique key in the string.
*   The SFILES string is then to be sent to a sequence-to-sequence transformer/LLM to process and learn the information during training phase and generate a Model.
*   The Transformers may make use of the Attention mechanism to learn the different variations of a valid and invalid SFILES string thereby, understanding the corrections needed.
*   The trained model shall identity the erroneous PSID drawing and respond with a corrected drawing/provide corrective options to the user

## Tech Stack Needed:
*   Python
*   NLP Basics
*   Knowledge on LLMs - Exploring the usage of open source LLMs
*   Streamlit Ul/React/JAVA Script
